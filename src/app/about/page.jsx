        IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of
        information related to films, television series, podcasts,
        home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“
        including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot
        summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. IMDb
        began as a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group in
        1990, and moved to the Web in 1993.

      <p>
        The title and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all
        users, but only registered and logged-in users can submit new
        material and suggest edits to existing entries. Most of the
        site data has been provided by these volunteers. Registered
        users with a proven track record are able to add and make
        corrections to cast lists, credits, and some other data
        points. However, the addition and removal of images, and
        alterations to titles, cast and crew names, character names,
        and plot summaries are subject to an approval process; this
        usually takes between 24 and 72 hours.

      <h2>User ratings of films</h2>
      <p>
        A s one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a rating scale that
        allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten. IMDb
        indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in
        various ways to produce a weighted mean that is displayed for
        each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used
        to avoid ballot stuffing; the method is not described in
        detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it.
